## Projects
### Automatic Number Plate Recognition
- **Date:** January 2024
- Developed an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system using the YOLOV8 object detection algorithm.
- Trained a custom YOLOV8 model on a labeled dataset of license plates, achieving high accuracy in identifying and locating license plates in images and videos.
- Implemented real-time processing capabilities for video feeds from traffic cameras, enabling rapid and precise detection of moving vehicles' license plates.
- Utilized optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to extract text from cropped license plates, resulting in highly accurate recognition rates.

### Spiking Neural Network (SNN)
- **Date:** March 2024
- Designed and implemented a spiking neural network (SNN) architecture for classification of the MNIST dataset, achieving a test set accuracy of 98.68%.
- Employed the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model to create a multi-layer SNN, consisting of input, hidden, and output layers.
- Used surrogate gradient descent optimization techniques to optimize the weights and biases of the network, taking advantage of the spiking nature of the LIF model.

### Transformer-Based Architecture, Classification Model
- **Date:** March 2024
- Built a transformer-based architecture for end-to-end crop disease classification, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies among pixels and spectral bands using vision and swin transformer.
- Prepared a large-scale dataset of multispectral images of healthy and diseased crops, employing data augmentation techniques to increase variability and mitigate overfitting.
- Engineered input representations tailored to the unique characteristics of the transformer architecture, accounting for differences in scale, orientation, and modality.
